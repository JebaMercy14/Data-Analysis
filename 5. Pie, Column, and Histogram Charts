Concepts

Frequency Tables in Excel
Frequency tables are a powerful tool for summarizing categorical data. In Excel, you can create frequency tables using the COUNTIF function, which has the syntax =COUNTIF(range, criteria). Here, range refers to the categorical data you’re analyzing, and criteria is the condition used to count values. This function can be defined interactively using the fx (Insert Function) tool.

Guidelines for Using Different Types of Charts
Pie Chart
A pie chart is ideal when:

You want to compare parts to the whole.
You only have 2 or 3 pieces of categorical data to compare.
You want to understand how categories compare to each other.
You aren’t comparing changes over time.
The underlying data represents 100% of the situation you are reporting; you can’t leave out any pieces of the pie!
Column Chart
A column chart is useful when:

You want to compare different categories.
You have 3 to 12 categories to compare.
You want to show changes over time.
You wish to find the largest, smallest, or most common value.
The order of the categories isn’t necessarily important.
Histogram Chart
A histogram chart is beneficial when:

You have continuous numerical data.
You want to know how frequently ranges of values occur in your data.
You have a large dataset you want to summarize quickly.
